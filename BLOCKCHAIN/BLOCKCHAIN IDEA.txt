Document authentication in Educational field using Blockchain Technology
Traditional way to authenticate educational certificate is time consuming, may require third party to verify certificates, chances certificates alter/fraud. So to avoid such issues I developed this project where I used Blockchain technology and IPFS. So idea is simple, university will store certificates on IPFS and make transaction of same through university's smart contract. So of that students can verify heir certificates either using digital copy of certificate or hash provided by university. Everything is securely processed and their is no chance fraud or alter of certificate, if done smart contract return negative response.
